# Hangman

## Description

<img align="right" width=343 height=353 src="src/assets/images/hangman-README.png">
<p align="left">Hangman is a game where a player is given a blank set of spaces,
representative to the length of an unknown word. Players are then
given a topic as to what that word could be, and are given a set
amount of guesses they can make before losing the game. The goal is
to correctly guess the unknown word before their number of attempts
run out</p>

<p>The purpose of this application was to gain more practice building a React app completely from scratch, and to have a better understanding of Webpack. I also wanted to design a classic game without any outside help; no tutorials were followed. This challenged my critical thinking, problem-solving, and debugging skills. I truly had a fun experience building this application, and now I get to have a fun time playing it! I hope you test it out for yourself and have a fun time as well.</p>
