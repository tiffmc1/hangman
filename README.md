<img align="right" width=343 height=353 src="/assets/images/hangman-README.png">
<p align="left">Hangman is a game where a player is given a blank set of spaces,
representative to the length of an unknown word. Players are then
given a topic as to what that word could be, and are given a set
amount of guesses they can make before losing the game. The goal is
to correctly guess the unknown word before their number of attempts
run out</p>
